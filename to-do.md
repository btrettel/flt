# To-do

Priorities:

- Switch pure logger to use `allocatable` variables. This will make flang-new complain less.
    - Remove `target` attribute as appropriate too.
        - unittest.f90, `start_tests`
        - test_ga.f90
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterbenz_lemma>: Make `assert_sterbenz` to assert that the conditions of the Sterbenz lemma are satisfied.
    - In `fmad` and `genunits`, create an operator that automatically enforces this? `.minus.`?
    - Other operators in `fmad` could benefit from this too. Anywhere a subtraction occurs (like the derivatives for division) could have a Sterbenz assertions version.
- fmad.f90: Change `%dv` to `%d`
- Switch `make check` to `make test` for consistency with folder name.
- convergence.f90:
    - <https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/tutorial/verify.f90>
        - <https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/wind/valid/tutorial/spatconv.html>
        - <https://pypi.org/project/convergence/>
        - <https://www.reddit.com/r/CFD/comments/1ltf188/doubts_about_validation_of_results/n1pyqoh/>
- ga.f90:
    - If all are infeasible, select pop best from infeasible. `f_max_infeasible`
    - Instead of `sum_g`, make `g` an array so you can identify which constraints are violated and assert that each component is >= 0
    - Note to make components of `sum_g` all order 1 to prevent underflow.
        - Assert that `sum_g` is not larger than 100 and not smaller than 1e-2. Assertions can be disabled with `check_sum_g=.false.` in `config`.
        - Make constraint subroutines automatically scale `sum_g` appropriately.
    - In `evaluate`, for infeasible individuals `f = f_max + sum_g*abs(f_max)` is better from a round-off error perspective if `sum_g` is far smaller than `f_max` and `sum_g` is order 1.
    - Add more tests for flt ga.f90 in general
        - Add test to check that `pop%best_pop_indiv` is set correctly.
        - Add test for constrained optimization.
            - <https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/lagrangemultipliers.aspx>
    - Meta-optimization
        - Make `evaluate` and `optimize_ga` `recursive`.
    - `write_restart_file` and `read_restart_file`
    - `stop_now` file can stop GA
        - Can be disabled, intended to be disabled in inner optimization for metaoptimization.
    - `config%stop_f` option to make GA stop at a particular value of `f`
    - `config%stop_time`
    - different return codes depending on how `optimize` stopped
        - `rc <= 0`: success
            - 0: stopped due to `n_gener`
            - -1: stopped due to `stop_now` file
            - -2: stopped due to `stop_f`
            - -3: stopped due to `stop_time`
            - At end of optimization, report error if none satisfy constraints.
        - `rc >= 1`: failure
    - population statistics: mean, standard deviation
        - `call pop_stats(...)`
    - Assert that objective values are finite. This will help catch bugs in objective functions and ensure that the population statistics are meaningful.
    - Add ability to insert an arbitrary number of pre-specified seeds to the initial population.
    - Break `g_sum` into `g_sum_pre` for before the solver is run and `g_sum_post` for after the solver is run. Some constraint violations may make running the solver impossible. Individuals which have non-zero `g_sum_pre` will take `g_sum_post` values equal to the maximum `g_sum_post` value. This will incentivize satisfying the pre-constraints.
    - Report fraction of population not satisfying constraints in printout.
    - Check notes on testing optimization algorithms for more ideas.
    - `config%log = .true.` (`.false.` by default) will write `pop.nml` containing information about every individual.
    - Latin hypercube sampling for initial population
        - Probably better to use Halton sequence since I intend to use that for gradient-based optimization. The two are similar and this will save time.

        - Matlab `lhsdesign`
    - Test `standard_ga_config`
    - To improve convergence to the global optimum better:
        - Multi-start

- returncodes.f90: A module containing `errno` codes, other internal return codes.
- fmad.f90 and units.f90
    - `is_close`
- unittest.f90
    - Instead of `integer_eq`, `real_eq`, use generic `eq`.
    - Ensure that all test messages are unique.
    - Keep track of test results so that you know whether a test has ever failed, and thus whether it is discriminating. (bowes_how_2017 p. 3L)
        - Also track which assertions have never failed?
    - Add optional argument `brittle` to tests that may be brittle, so that their failures can be ignored if desired.
    - dataplot-like approach to ease adding tests (but use namelists instead of a single CSV file)
- f90lint: Simple linter for Fortran to enforce anything that can't be enforced with a regex linter.
    - Check that assertions have unique messages. List relevant variable values in error message.
    - Check that assertion messages follow proper template.
    - Change `skip_indexing` to `dont_lint`, make other changes to make the input file clearer.
    - check for `implicit none`
- `io.f90`
    - read and save CSV files
        - regex validation field for CSV
- Add Valgrind back to check-fc. Suppress namelist derived-type input problem in Valgrind.

Later:

- When work has ifx 2024.2, change `assert` to eliminate `full_message` by putting the message directly on the `error stop` line. Also see [compiler-bugs report0002](https://github.com/btrettel/compiler-bugs/tree/main/report0002).
