# Summary: Makefile for Public domain POSIX make
# Standard: POSIX (tested on GNU Make, BSD Make, pdpmake, and Microsoft NMAKE)

# Tested with [Public domain POSIX make on Linux](https://frippery.org/make/). Works with `pdpmake -f PDPmakefile`. Intended mostly to make sure that common.mk and depends.mk are POSIX compliant. Due to limitations of pdpmake, specifying `BUILD` and `FC` on the command line will not work.

.POSIX:

.PRAGMA: target_name posix_202x

# defaults
FC    = gfortran
BUILD = debug

# Only gfortran with BUILD=debug for now.

FFLAGS ::= $(FFLAGS) $(DFLAGS)
