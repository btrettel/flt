# Summary: Makefile for Public domain POSIX make
# Standard: POSIX (tested on GNU Make, BSD Make, pdpmake, and Microsoft NMAKE)

# Tested with [Public domain POSIX make on Linux](https://frippery.org/make/). Works with `pdpmake -f PDPmakefile`. Intended mostly to make sure that common.mk and depends.mk are POSIX compliant. Due to limitations of pdpmake, specifying `BUILD` and `FC` on the command line will not work.

# Only gfortran with BUILD=debug for now.
