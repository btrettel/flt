# `-Werror=uninitialized` seems to require `-fcheck=all` (not used in the release build), or else there's a false-positive compile-time error, at least for gfortran 13. Check if this is true for later versions. `-Wno-uninitialized` eliminates this false-positive and should be removed in the future if gfortran eliminates this problem.
# `-fsanitize=leak` seems to continue to have false positives as of gfortran 13.
# `-Wdo-subscript` seems to have false positives.
# I think I had some false positives before that made me add `-Wno-maybe-uninitialized`, but it seems unnecessary now.

# Making `-finit-integer=2147483647` is better than making it a large negative number.
# Say you have a loop: `do i = 1, n` and you forget to initialize `n`.
# If `n` is arbitrarily large then this will eventually return an out-of-bounds array error.
# gfortran's uninitialized variable detection seems to not detect this.

# `-march=native` may make the code not run on different machines, but that's not an issue for me.
